# Life Expectancy and GDP Data Visualization Project
The goal of this project was to analyze and visualize data about Life Expectancy and GDP of 6 different countries(Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, United States of America, Zimbabwe) using Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn.
I also wanted to find association between these two variables, to do this I used Pearson's correlation from SciPy. Data is from Codecademy's Data Scientist Career Path.
